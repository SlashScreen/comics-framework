# Comics framework
## What is it?
This is a tool for being able to easily cycle through comic pages! Well, any gallery really.
## How do I use it?
-Want to upload new pages?
1) run 
`$ cd path/to/clone/folder
$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
2) run '$ python3 image-pipeline.py'
3) Choose a directory of new comic to upload
-How do I change how it looks?
All you need to do is change the CSS code! it is located in `style/main.css`
-Where do I upload it to my site?
That's up to you! I'd put it in its own folder though...
